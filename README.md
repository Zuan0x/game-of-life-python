# Conway's Game of Life in Python

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame.

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The cells evolve through generations based on a set of rules, creating interesting and often unpredictable patterns.

## Features

- **Grid Interaction:** Click and hold the left mouse button to toggle the state of cells.
- **Simulation Control:** Start and stop the simulation to observe the evolution of the cellular automaton.
- **Randomize Grid:** Randomize the initial state of the grid by clicking the "Randomize" button.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pygame`.
2. Run the script: `python game_of_life.py`.

## Controls

- **Left Mouse Click:** Toggle the state of individual cells or start/stop the simulation.
- **Left Mouse Click and Drag:** Change the state of multiple cells.
- **"Start" Button:** Start or stop the simulation.
- **"Randomize" Button:** Randomize the initial state of the grid (only clickable when the simulation is not running).

## Customize

Feel free to customize the script by adjusting colors, grid size, or any other parameters to suit your preferences.
